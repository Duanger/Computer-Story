This is the Start node. Write the beginning of your Yarn story here.
// You can make comments with '//' and the player won't see it.

// There's two ways to do choices in Yarn. The most basic way is to link to other nodes like this:
[[Go see more examples|Start_MoreExamples]]
[[Actually, let's restart this node again|Start]]

// IMPORTANT: node options are only offered at the end of the passage

This node is called Start_MoreExamples.
The second way to do choices in Yarn is with 'shortcut options' like this:

->This is option 1
	You selected option 1.
->This is option 2
	You selected option 2.
	<<set $didOption2 to true>>

Based on choices, you can set variables, and then check those variables later.
<<if $didOption2 is true>>
By checking $didOption2, I remember you chose option 2!
<<else>>
I can't detect a variable $didOption2, so that means you chose option 1
<<endif>>

Do you want to go back to Start now?
-> Yes, send me back to Start.
	[[Start]]
-> No thanks, I want to stop.

Ok here's the end, good luck!
